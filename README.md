Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and verification of a low-power 32-bit microprocessor. The design follows a structured pipeline architecture and includes key components such as Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU), ALU, Control Unit, Register File, and Memory Interfaces. Verification is performed using SystemVerilog testbenches, and power optimization techniques such as Unified Power Format (UPF) are implemented.

1. Microprocessor Architecture

The microprocessor follows a 5-stage pipeline design with the following key modules:
	•	Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU.v): Fetches instructions from the instruction memory.
	•	Instruction Memory (INST_MEM.v): Stores the program instructions for execution.
	•	Control Unit (CONTROL.v): Generates control signals to coordinate instruction execution.
	•	ALU (ALU.v): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
	•	Register File (REG_FILE.v): Stores temporary data for processing.
	•	Datapath (DATAPATH.v): Manages the flow of data between components.
	•	Processor (PROCESSOR.v): Integrates all modules into a working microprocessor.
	•	Testbench (Processor_tb.v): Validates the functionality of the processor using test stimuli.
